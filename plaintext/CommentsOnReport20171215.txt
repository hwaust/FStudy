Is is updated? It seems just reformatted in PDF and not revised. An
obvious typo ("targe") remains, which suggests that it did not pass a
mechanical spell-checking.

At least, it is not self-contained at all. For example, why did you
not describe even the experimental environment fully? It means that
you make us find the HaoDesk spec for previous emails and the
matsu-lab cluster spec for wiki. This is simply laziness incurring
inefficiency and a wrong attitude to writing, as we have been saying
repeatedly.

Did you compare the results with the baseline? What is the description
"(xm3.org = 63.32s)"? We did not write the ADBIS submission in such a
way. Is it readable as comparison? If you had followed the ADBIS
submission, you would have written both in a table.

Section 1.4 Discussion on Queries mentions data-partitioned queries
and show the results of some of them. You, however, have not analyzed
the results. Where did "problems" you said go to?

The following are rather technical questions:

  * Why did you scale P from 1 to 12?

  * Is the speedup in scaling P (especially, P > 4) explicable?

  * Is your implementation complete? If not, how much reliable are the
    current experimental results? The current failures of query
    evaluation seem just to indicate incompleteness.

  * Can data-partitioning querying over disk-based instances on
    HaoDesk make speedup? Although I asked you for a related question
    before, you seem to stop considering and answering.

  * Is the memory of the matsu-lab cluster enough for in-memory
     querying over xmark600? In your previous estimation, it is not.

Where is your intention described? No explanation.

In this context, to be "updated" asked by Matsuzaki-sensei is to
revise so as to follow our instructions and make the contents
informative (and optionally, to add new results if available).

So, the report did not obey even our instructions on the minimum
requirements for communication: to eliminate (obvious) typos and
errors and to make it self-contained.

It is sufficient to doubt your "updated" to me.

Addtionally, the report becomes worse in some sense.

Part of what you said in the previous report in email is simply
missing without explanation. For example,

>>>>>>>>>> - xm5a.dps and xm5b.dps
>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>     Both of the queries can be evaluated and the results are
>>>>>>>>>>  correct.
>>>>>>>>>>     But the efficiency is a problems. Both query took longer time
>>>>>>>>>>  than

Where did this problem go to? Moreover, I do not have the things
"reported a couple of days ago" by you. What is that?

There is a lot of inconsistency, which makes us get lost.

You thus have forgot our instruction of making explanation consistent.


For example, we asked many times that "from which to which, do the times of
prefix/suffix/merge... stand for?"

You should have recorded more logs including the execution time of each part
on each thread.  Why not showing us them?

Why not trying to write "less-error" document from the beginning?
There are several "good practices" for less-error writing,
and have you tried to import them in your writing?

You should pay more time for "update them periodically", which
may waste both your and our time.

I cannot understand why you "failed to correct all the typos even if they were
found after checking".  If you use some tool correctly, it should be avoided.

Did you expected that we really remember the information in mind or
can restore it much faster than looking it in the same document?

You should pay more attention for the arrangement of information,
not just putting all the data just in a file.

We cannot know your progress (not done) without explicit declaration.

Please let us know your consideration after the experiments with P > 4.
Your report just showed the data, and you forced us to read and consider by ourselves.

Then, show your improved estimation or concrete observation with numbers
to convince us for in-memory querying.

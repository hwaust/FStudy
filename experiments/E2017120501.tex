To find the reason, I used count() function tested the following 
queries, Q1--Q5 (Q1 is the original) over XMark600 using HaoLab.\\ 
\verb|Q1:/site//incategory[./@category="category52"]/parent::item/@id|\\
\verb|Q2:/site//incategory[./@category="category52"]|\\
\verb|Q3:/site//incategory[@category]|\\
\verb|Q4:/site//incategory[contains(@category, "52")]|\\
\verb|Q5:/site//incategory[contains(@category, "category52")]|\\

The results are listed as below:

 
count(Q1) = count(Q2) = 0, count(Q3) = 49,514,754, count(Q4) =  2,720,824 and count(Q5) = 895,154. 

I then outputted the results of Q4 and Q5. After checking the 
results, I did not found any node match "category52".
Note: for Q5, what I found were nodes with contents started with 
\texttt{category52} such as 

\verb|<incategory category="category526763"/>|. 

Therefore, the reason is simply that no "incategory" node has 
an attribute with content of "category52". To make sure this 
conclusion, I also ran the queries on both my desktop PC in the 
lab and the compute at my home. The results are the same.

Therefore, the results of xm2.org E2017120401 in report are correct.

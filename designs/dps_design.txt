I update my hypothesis about the overhead:

Since the process of prefix query, including evaluating, inserting results  to
intermediate database and loading the results are the overhead of the  whole
query, it is thus better to reduce both the execution time for prefix query and
the size of its results. One way to reduce the execution of prefix is to shorten
the prefix query, i.e. reduce the number of steps in it.  For example, use
/site/* instead of /site/*/*. Under this hypothesis, I then make the following
queries for data partitioning strategy.

The result sizes of db:attribute(), db:attribute()/parent::incategory, and 
db:attribute()/parent::incategory.../...item are the same. Since the prefix 
query itself is a overhead, it is better to make it shorter as above.
